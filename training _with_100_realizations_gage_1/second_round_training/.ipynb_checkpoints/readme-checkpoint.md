**A second round of training** was conducted to assess whether model performance could be improved, given that **the first round successfully calibrated the Manningâ€™s values,** resulting in a good match between the **simulated streamflow** and the **observed streamflow from USGS**. The **SNPE model** was trained using the same **100 realizations** as in the first round.
