The **objective is to compare** the summary statistics of the simulated streamflow to those of the real-world observations from USGS and determine **which training provides a better match**.  

**The results** show that although both simulations produced streamflow values close to the observations, the simulated streamflow from the **100 realizations training** had a mean and standard deviation closer to the real-world observations, indicating a better match.
