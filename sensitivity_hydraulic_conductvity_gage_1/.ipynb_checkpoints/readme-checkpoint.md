# Response of Streamflow When Varying Hydraulic Conductivity at Gage 1 (01608500)

## 1. Decreasing *k* Below a Certain Threshold Has No Effect on Streamflow

Reducing hydraulic conductivity (*K*) further does not drastically change the flow, because the streamflow is primarily driven by runoff (precipitation) rather than by subsurface (groundwater) contributions.

Therefore, hydraulic conductivity should **not be included in the calibration**, since it does not affect the peak flows shown in the hydrograph.

It is possible that during a different period (with a different start and end date), the streamflow could be influenced by *K*, or part of the flow could originate from groundwater.

## 2. Increasing *k* Allows Subsurface Water to Move More Easily to the Stream

Hydraulic conductivity controls how fast groundwater or subsurface water can move through the soil and rock.

- When you increase *K*, more water (groundwater) travels through the subsurface, discharging into the stream.
- This increases **baseflow during dry periods**, sustaining streamflow even when there is no rainfall.
